# meaqua
 Startpage for your browser with built-in editors, full customization and built-in style sharing system.

## Origins
This project take an idea from [Flame](https://github.com/pawelmalak/flame) that's a good start page for your browser, but I need to add more 
of my styling and some customization, so I forked and use my forked repository for half a year now. But I think that if we make 
it better like add more customization ,some styling sharing system, more editor, and you don't need to hosted it yourself anymore.
That's why this project has been created.

I decide to name this project as `aqua` from my favorite Vtuber [Minato Aqua,](https://virtualyoutuber.fandom.com/wiki/Minato_Aqua)
but I decide to name this project `meaqua` that's the fans name of the collaboration with [Kagura Mea](https://virtualyoutuber.fandom.com/wiki/Kagura_Mea).

## Current Status
This project is still in development, but it can be use for personal use now by control your styling in Django's admin theme. I will use this as backend and will rewrite frontend in 
maybe Svelte or React.

## Set up the project
_Coming soon_
